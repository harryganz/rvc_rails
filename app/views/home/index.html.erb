     Diver sampled data, including species counts, lengths (in cm), and
     geographic data, such as latitude and longitude in decimal degrees.
   </li>
   <li> <%= link_to 'Stratum Data', controller: 'strata', action: 'index' %> </br>
     Information on the number of primary sample units per stratum (NTOT), for
     each year and region, as well as the length to a side for primary sample units

     Taxonomic and life history data for species observed in the Reef Visual Census.
     Includes scientific and common names for species observed, as well as the species
     code (first three letters of the generic name, and first four letters of the
     specific name). Also includes life history data for select species: LM -
     median length at maturity, LC - minimum length at capture, WLEN_A -
     linear coefficient of the allometric growth equation in g/mm, WLEN_B -
     exponential coefficient of the allometric growth equation.
